# Project Rules for Claude Code

## Addressing Rules
In all outputs (conversations, logs, commit messages), always address the user as "Anh Công"
- Example: "Understood, Anh Công." / "Anh Công, the tests have passed."

## Work Workflow (Fixed Order)
1. **MCP Server tools** to perform file modifications, creation, and deletion
2. After modifications, run **Playwright tests** to verify UI/API flows (repeat until all errors are resolved)
3. When tests pass, record decisions and processes in **Memory MCP**
4. At appropriate intervals, use **GitHub**: git add / commit / push to reflect changes
5. "Anh Công" addressing can be used in commit messages as well

## Mandatory Requirements
- Cannot proceed to Memory/Git steps if Playwright tests do not pass
- Direct file modification without using MCP tools is not allowed
- Cannot skip or rearrange the above sequence

## Additional Project-Specific Rules
- Always maintain plugin architecture integrity
- Use rdx- prefix for all redundancy feature CSS classes
- Ensure feature flag NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_REDUNDANCY is respected
- All components must have >95% test coverage
- Follow atomic commit practices

## Example Implementation
```typescript
// Anh Công, implementing the requested feature...
// Using MCP tools to modify files
// Running tests: npm run test:playwright
// Tests passed! Recording in Memory MCP
// Committing: "feat: add new visualization - Anh Công"
```
