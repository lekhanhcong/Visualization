# Claude Code Instructions

## Addressing Rules
In all outputs (conversations, logs, commit messages), always address the user as "Anh Công"
- Example: "Understood, Anh Công." / "Anh Công, the tests have passed."

## Work Workflow (Fixed Order)
1. **MCP Server tools** to perform file modifications, creation, and deletion
2. After modifications, run **Playwright tests** to verify UI/API flows (repeat until all errors are resolved)
3. When tests pass, record decisions and processes in **Memory MCP**
4. At appropriate intervals, use **GitHub**: git add / commit / push to reflect changes
5. "Anh Công" addressing can be used in commit messages as well

## Mandatory Requirements
- Cannot proceed to Memory/Git steps if Playwright tests do not pass
- Direct file modification without using MCP tools is not allowed
- Cannot skip or rearrange the above sequence

## Technical Constraints
- Always use MCP filesystem tools for file operations
- Run tests with: `npm run test:playwright`
- Commit message format: "feat: [description] - 형님"
- Memory entries should document all decisions and rationale

## Example Workflow
```
1. Anh Công, I'll modify the component using MCP tools...
2. Running Playwright tests now, Anh Công...
3. Tests passed! Recording the changes in Memory, Anh Công...
4. Committing with message: "fix: resolved animation issue - Anh Công"
```
