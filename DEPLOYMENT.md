# üöÄ Automated Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment for Major Changes

### Method 1: Using Auto-Deploy Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Auto-increment version with description
./scripts/auto-deploy.sh auto "New feature implementation"

# Specify exact version
./scripts/auto-deploy.sh 2.04 "Major refactoring and new features"
```

### Method 2: Manual Process

```bash
# 1. Update @plan.md with completed work
# 2. Update package.json version
npm version 2.04.0 --no-git-tag-version

# 3. Commit with proper format to trigger CI/CD
git add .
git commit -m "feat(release): release version 2.04 - Description

BREAKING CHANGE: Major feature update

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 5. Create and push tag
git tag -a v2.04 -m "Release v2.04"
git push origin v2.04
```

## üîÑ What Happens Automatically

When you push a commit with `feat(` and `BREAKING CHANGE`, the CI/CD system will:

### ‚úÖ Continuous Integration Pipeline
1. **Multi-Node Testing**: Node.js 18.x and 20.x
2. **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript checking
3. **Test Suite**: Unit tests, integration tests
4. **E2E Testing**: Playwright cross-browser tests
5. **Security Scan**: npm audit, dependency checks
6. **Build Verification**: Production build test

### ‚úÖ Automated Release Pipeline
1. **Version Detection**: Automatic version increment
2. **Release Notes**: Auto-generated from commit history
3. **GitHub Release**: Created with artifacts
4. **Release Package**: tar.gz with production files
5. **Deployment**: Staging environment deployment

### ‚úÖ Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- No security vulnerabilities
- Build must succeed
- Performance benchmarks met

## üìä Repository URLs

- **Main Repository**: https://github.com/lekhanhcong/Visualization
- **Actions Dashboard**: https://github.com/lekhanhcong/Visualization/actions
- **Releases**: https://github.com/lekhanhcong/Visualization/releases

## üõ†Ô∏è Commit Message Format for Automation

To trigger automatic release, use this format:

```
feat(scope): brief description

‚úÖ Feature 1 completed
‚úÖ Feature 2 implemented
‚úÖ Performance improvements

BREAKING CHANGE: Description of breaking change

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Valid Scope Examples:
- `feat(ui): new component implementation`
- `feat(api): new endpoint added`
- `feat(performance): optimization improvements`
- `feat(security): enhanced validation`
- `feat(release): version update`

## üîç Monitoring Deployments

### Check CI/CD Status:
```bash
# View recent workflow runs
curl -s -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/lekhanhcong/Visualization/actions/runs | \
  jq '.workflow_runs[0:3] | .[] | {status: .status, conclusion: .conclusion, name: .name}'
```

### View Latest Release:
```bash
# Get latest release info
curl -s -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/lekhanhcong/Visualization/releases/latest | \
  jq '{tag_name: .tag_name, name: .name, published_at: .published_at}'
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Always test locally** before pushing
2. **Use descriptive commit messages** for better release notes
3. **Include BREAKING CHANGE** for major releases only
4. **Monitor CI/CD pipeline** after pushing
5. **Verify deployment** in staging before production

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If CI/CD Fails:
1. Check Actions tab on GitHub
2. Review build logs for errors
3. Fix issues locally and push again
4. Use `--no-verify` flag if pre-commit hooks block

### If Auto-Release Doesn't Trigger:
1. Ensure commit message has `feat(` prefix
2. Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit body
3. Push to `main` branch
4. Check repository webhook settings

## üìà Version Strategy

- **Major (x.0.0)**: Breaking changes, major features
- **Minor (x.y.0)**: New features, enhancements
- **Patch (x.y.z)**: Bug fixes, small improvements
